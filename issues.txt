Issue 2: Fix grow -c incorrect error reporting

    Given the directory structure:

        a
           b
              c
                 hello.txt
                 world
                    check1.txt
                    check2.txt

    Grow creates the correct directory structure but incorrectly reports that it
    failed to create check1.txt and check2.txt under hello.txt, which shouldn't
    be possible in the first place.
